# Solution Deployment via Power Platform Pipelines

Expert reference for deploying Dataverse solutions through Power Platform Pipelines via the dataverse-modelling-mcp server.

## Hard prerequisites

- **Pipeline-Host environment is separate.** The `deploymentpipeline`, `deploymentstage`, and `deploymentstagerun` entities live in a dedicated Pipeline-Host env (often hidden from non-admin users in the BAP environments list). The source/Dev env (where the solution actually lives) does NOT have these entities. All pipeline calls go against the Pipeline-Host URL — never against the source/target.
- **Permission** (on the TARGET env, not the Pipeline-Host): the deploying user must have `prvImportCustomization` on each target environment the pipeline imports into. Without it, **validation itself fails** — the run goes to `stagerunstatus = Fehlgeschlagen` and `validationresults` contains `SecLib::CheckPrivilege failed … PrivilegeName: prvImportCustomization` with the user/BU GUID of the *target* env. Granting the user a Pipeline-Host group/role does NOT help — it must be a role carrying `prvImportCustomization` (e.g. System Customizer) on the target. Verified `2026-06-02`: the same failure occurs identically in the Maker UI, confirming it is purely a target-env permission, not an MCP issue. After a role change allow for security-cache propagation / re-login.
- **Environment write policy** (per project memory): `contoso-dev` writable without confirmation, `contoso-staging` and `xv` need explicit user confirmation before triggering a pipeline that writes there.
- **⚠️ Token-AppId blocker — headless pipeline deploy via the direct API does NOT currently work** (empirically established `2026-06-02`). The Pipeline-Backend's validation workflow only fires for runs created by the **Power Apps Maker portal** AppId `a8f7a65c-f5ba-4859-b2d6-df772c264e9d`. A run created with any other appid returns HTTP 201 but stays in `Nicht gestartet` forever (validation never starts). The problem: a headless MCP **cannot mint an `a8f7a65c` token** —
  - Device Code Flow directly with `a8f7a65c` → token redemption fails with `AADSTS7000218` (requires a client_secret; not a public client for device-code).
  - FOCI refresh-token exchange to `a8f7a65c` (from Azure CLI `04b07795` or PAC `9cee029c`) → `AADSTS70000` (not in the same client family).
  - The current code authenticates as PAC CLI (`9cee029c`) — that token IS obtainable headlessly but is NOT accepted by the backend → runs hang at `Nicht gestartet`.
  
  So `solution_deploy_pipeline` / `pipeline_auth_init` are effectively non-functional for committing a deploy. The create-payload, sequence, and `DeployPackageAsync` call are otherwise correct (verified call-for-call against a Maker-UI HAR capture). **Recommended deployment path for MCP: the file-based `solution_export` + `solution_import`** (normal Dataverse token, no appid gate). Pipelines remain a Maker-UI (or PAC CLI) operation. Read-only Pipeline calls (`pipeline_list`/`pipeline_stages`/`pipeline_environments`/`pipeline_run_status`) work fine — they are not appid-gated. The Auth-Code + PKCE avenue was also tested (`2026-06-02`) and **fails**: `a8f7a65c` has no manually-capturable redirect URI registered — both `http://localhost` and `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient` return `AADSTS50011` (redirect mismatch); only the Maker portal's own web origins are registered, which can't be captured from a CLI. **Conclusion: there is no headless way to obtain an `a8f7a65c` token — `solution_deploy_pipeline` cannot be made to work from a headless MCP. Use file-based export/import instead.**

## Tool map

| User intent | MCP tool |
|---|---|
| List pipelines on a host | `pipeline_list(pipelineHostOrgUrl)` |
| List stages of a pipeline | `pipeline_stages(pipelineHostOrgUrl, pipelineId)` |
| Map Power-Platform env GUID → pipeline-internal `deploymentenvironmentid` | `pipeline_environments(pipelineHostOrgUrl)` |
| **One-time Maker-AppId login (Device Code Flow)** | `pipeline_auth_init(pipelineHostOrgUrl)` |
| **Full deploy (validate + commit + start)** | `solution_deploy_pipeline(...)` with `autoConfirm=true` |
| Validation-only dry run | `solution_deploy_pipeline(...)` with `autoConfirm=false` |
| Poll a run's status | `pipeline_run_status(pipelineHostOrgUrl, stageRunId)` |

## The 3-/4-call Maker-UI workflow

When a user clicks "Bereitstellung" on a stage card in the Maker UI, the browser makes three or four sequential calls (depending on whether the solution has pflicht-zu-setzende environment variables / connection references on the target). Our `solution_deploy_pipeline` mirrors them when `autoConfirm=true`. Documented here for the case the tool needs extending.

### Step 1 — POST: create stage run, kick off validation
```http
POST {pipelineHostOrgUrl}/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns?$select=deploymentstagerunid

{
  "artifactname": "<solution-unique-name>",
  "devdeploymentenvironment@odata.bind": "/deploymentenvironments(<devDeploymentEnvironmentId>)",
  "deploymentstageid@odata.bind": "/deploymentstages(<targetStageId>)",
  "makerainoteslanguagecode": "de-DE",
  "solutionid": "<solution-guid-from-source-env>"
}
→ 201 Created
{ "deploymentstagerunid": "<new-run-guid>" }
```

Validation now runs server-side; the row's `stagerunstatus` walks through Nicht gestartet → Überprüfen → Überprüfung erfolgreich. **Skipping steps 2+3 leaves the run hanging at "Nicht gestartet" forever** — this is the trap that the older deprecated `pipelines({id})/Deploy` endpoint never explained.

### Step 2a (optional) — PATCH: set environment variables & connection-reference overrides

Only sent if the solution has any pflicht-zu-setzende EnvVars or ConnRefs on the target. The UI shows this as the "Umgebungsvariablen"-step in the dialog. Skip when there are none.

```http
PATCH {pipelineHostOrgUrl}/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns({runId})

{
  "deploymentsettingsjson": "{\"EnvironmentVariables\":[{\"SchemaName\":\"sample_my_var\",\"Value\":\"42\"}],\"ConnectionReferences\":[]}"
}
→ 204 No Content
```

The `deploymentsettingsjson` field is a stringified inner JSON. Schema name comes from the env-var's logical name in Dataverse; value is a string regardless of the env-var's actual type (decimal/boolean/etc — Pipeline coerces server-side).

### Step 2b — PATCH: set version + notes
```http
PATCH {pipelineHostOrgUrl}/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns({runId})

{
  "artifactdevcurrentversion": "1.10.0",
  "artifactversion":           "1.11.0",
  "deploymentnotes":           "what changed"
}
→ 204 No Content
```

`artifactversion` is the new version the solution will carry after deploy. Maker UI typically auto-increments the second segment (`1.10.0 → 1.11.0`); we expose it as a required parameter for explicit control.

### Step 3 — POST: actually start the deploy
```http
POST {pipelineHostOrgUrl}/api/data/v9.0/DeployPackageAsync

{ "StageRunId": "<runId>" }
→ 204 No Content
```

The Pipeline-System workflow then takes over: solution gets exported from Dev, imported into the target stage's env. Total runtime observed: ~5–15 min depending on solution size and dependency tree.

## Stage-run status codes

The `stagerunstatus` and `operationstatus` fields use a shared option-set. Always read the `@OData.Community.Display.V1.FormattedValue` annotation for the localized label, but know the codes for code-side logic:

| Code | Label (DE) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 200000000 | Nicht gestartet | Run row created, validation queue not yet entered |
| 200000001 | Wird ausgeführt | Currently active (validation or deploy) |
| 200000002 | Erfolgreich | Terminal — completed without errors |
| 200000003 | Fehlgeschlagen | Terminal — see `validationresults` or `errormessage` |
| 200000004 | Abgebrochen / Cancelled | Terminal — user/system cancelled |
| 200000007 | Überprüfung erfolgreich | Validation OK, awaiting commit (steps 2+3) |
| 200000010 | Bereitstellung wird ausgeführt | Deploy in progress (after step 3) |

`operation` discriminates which sub-phase:
- 200000200 = Kein Wert (initial)
- 200000201 = Überprüfen
- 200000202 = Bereitstellen

## Validation duration & polling

Empirically: validation completes in 5–10 min on solutions with 10–100 components, can climb past 15 min on larger ones. Our service uses a default `validationTimeoutSeconds=600` (10 min) and polls every 10 s; raise both for big solutions. `solution_deploy_pipeline` polls server-side so the MCP call blocks until step 3 fires (or validation fails or times out).

## Permission pitfall — fast diagnosis

Symptom: validation completes but `validationresults` shows:
```
SecLib::CheckPrivilege failed.
User: <systemuserid>,
PrivilegeName: prvImportCustomization
```

The user-GUID in the error message is the **calling user on the target env**. Cross-check against an admin account. The error is fatal for the run — start a new one with the admin token.

## Pipeline vs. direct export/import — trade-offs

| Aspect | Pipeline | `solution_export` + `solution_import` |
|---|---|---|
| Audit / history | Auto-logged in `deploymentstagerun` | Manual notes only |
| Stage enforcement (Dev → Stage → Prod order) | Yes | No |
| Approval gates | Configurable per stage | None |
| Version bumping | Mandatory new `artifactversion` | Solution version is whatever the export says |
| Speed for ad-hoc | Slow (5–15 min) | Fast (1–3 min) |
| Works without Pipelines installed | No | Yes |
| Solution stays managed-only on target | Yes by default | Configurable |
| Auth | Maker-AppId token (Device Code Flow, `pipeline_auth_init`) | Regular Dataverse token — no extra login |

**Default to Pipeline** when staging/prod targets are involved. Use direct export/import for throwaway envs (`service-test`), bulk migrations, or — importantly — **as the robust fallback when host-managed Pipelines misbehave** (validation/auth/deploy issues).

### Direct export/import — capabilities (since 2026-06-01)

- **`solution_export(uniqueName, managed, filePath?)`** — with `filePath` the zip is written to local disk and only the path + byte size come back; without it the base64 is returned inline. Use `filePath` for large solutions to avoid pumping megabytes of base64 through the MCP channel.
- **`solution_import(filePath? | zipBase64?, overwriteUnmanaged, timeoutSeconds=600)`** — runs the **async** `ImportSolutionAsync` action (not the timeout-prone sync `ImportSolution`), polls the `asyncoperation` until terminal, and returns `Success` (driven by async statuscode 30) plus `ComponentErrors[]` parsed from the ImportJob's `data` XML. Provide `filePath` to read the zip from disk (preferred) or `zipBase64` inline.
- Architecture note: the **PAC CLI was deliberately NOT used** as the engine (own auth store, external-process dependency). If deeper SDK features are ever needed, the **`ServiceClient` SDK with `tokenProviderFunction`** (reuses `DataverseTokenProvider`) is the preferred next step — not the CLI. See memory `project_solution_import_export_architecture`.

## Crossvertise reference values

For the live setup observed on `2026-05-22`. Verify before relying on these — pipeline configuration changes and IDs are tenant-specific.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Pipeline-Host org URL** | `https://orgexample.crm4.dynamics.com` |
| Pipeline „Crossvertise" `deploymentpipelineid` | `397990f9-10ee-ef11-9341-6045bda0fa8d` |
| Stage „contoso-staging" `deploymentstageid` | `8acb88ff-10ee-ef11-9341-6045bda0fa8d` (first stage, `previous=null`) |
| Stage „xv" (Prod) `deploymentstageid` | `935ec311-cd05-f011-bae2-000d3aacedbc` (`previous=contoso-staging`) |
| Dev-env mapping (contoso-dev) `deploymentenvironmentid` | `377990f9-10ee-ef11-9341-6045bda0fa8d` |
| contoso-dev Power-Platform `environmentid` | `699d56e2-7f65-ebb0-ae92-2ae5e3a45159` |
| Admin account with `prvImportCustomization` | `admin@contoso.com` |

The `deploymentenvironmentid` (pipeline-internal mapping row id) is NOT the Power-Platform env GUID. Resolve via `pipeline_environments(pipelineHostOrgUrl)` and filter by `EnvironmentId` if you only know the PP env GUID.

## Typical workflows

### "Deploy CrossvertiseSales from contoso-dev → contoso-staging"
1. Capture current solution version: `mcp__dataverse-modelling-mcp__solution_get(uniqueName='CrossvertiseSales')` → `version` (e.g. `1.10.0`).
2. Compute target version (typically bump second segment: `1.10.0 → 1.11.0`).
3. Confirm contoso-staging write with the user (per project memory).
4. `solution_deploy_pipeline(pipelineHostOrgUrl, solutionId, artifactName='CrossvertiseSales', devDeploymentEnvironmentId, targetStageId=<contoso-staging>, currentVersion='1.10.0', newVersion='1.11.0', deploymentNotes='<reason>', autoConfirm=true)` — blocks ~6–10 min, returns `stageRunId`.
5. Poll `pipeline_run_status(pipelineHostOrgUrl, stageRunId)` until `stagerunstatus = Erfolgreich` (or Fehlgeschlagen).
6. On success: solution and its components (cloud flows, tables, etc.) are now in contoso-staging as managed.

### "Validate without deploying"
Same as above but `autoConfirm=false`. Tool returns immediately after step 1 with the runId. Inspect `pipeline_run_status` until `stagerunstatus = Überprüfung erfolgreich` and read `validationresults` JSON — useful to preview which components will be imported and to catch missing dependencies before committing.

### "Diagnose a failed run"
1. `pipeline_run_status(pipelineHostOrgUrl, stageRunId)` → look at `stagerunstatus@…FormattedValue` and `operationstatus@…FormattedValue`.
2. Parse `validationresults` JSON: `SolutionValidationResults[].Message`. For permission errors the user-GUID is in that string. For missing dependencies, `MissingDependencies` lists what's not in the target.
3. Common causes: missing `prvImportCustomization`, connection references not yet present on target, dependent solutions not yet deployed, target env not "managed-environment-enabled" (Pipeline UI shows a banner about this).

### "Roll back a deployed solution"
Pipelines do **not** offer one-click rollback. Options:
- Trigger a new pipeline deploy with an older `solutionid` snapshot (requires keeping snapshots in dev).
- Use solution layers (`solution_remove_active_layer`) to peel off the most recent unmanaged layer if the previous managed solution is still intact.
- Direct import of an older managed solution file (bypasses Pipeline audit but is fastest).

## Reverse-engineered endpoints (Maker UI parity)

Documented for the rare case the wrappers need extending.

| Call | URL | Method |
|---|---|---|
| List pipelines | `/api/data/v9.2/deploymentpipelines` | GET |
| List stages of a pipeline | `/api/data/v9.2/deploymentstages?$filter=_deploymentpipelineid_value eq {id}` | GET |
| Env mapping rows | `/api/data/v9.2/deploymentenvironments` | GET |
| Create stage run + start validation | `/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns?$select=deploymentstagerunid` | POST |
| Set version + notes | `/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns({runId})` | PATCH |
| Kick off actual deploy | `/api/data/v9.0/DeployPackageAsync` | POST |
| Poll a run's status | `/api/data/v9.0/deploymentstageruns({runId})?$select=stagerunstatus,errormessage,operation,operationdetails,operationstatus,validationresults,...` | GET |

API-version inconsistency (v9.2 for read, v9.0 for the run-creation + deploy actions) is intentional Microsoft-side — keep both.

## Pitfalls

- **Run hangs at "Nicht gestartet" forever** if you only do step 1. Always follow with PATCH + DeployPackageAsync (or use `autoConfirm=true`). The deprecated `pipelines({id})/Deploy` endpoint that older MCP code used is dead; do not call it.
- **`DeployPackageAsync` is unbound**, despite naming. Don't try `/deploymentstageruns({id})/DeployPackageAsync` — fails. It takes `StageRunId` in the body.
- **`api-version=2016-11-01` is wrong**. Pipelines use Dataverse Web API (`/api/data/v9.0` or `/api/data/v9.2`), not the PA Flow API.
- **outputsLink-style retrieval doesn't apply**. Stage-run details come back directly on GET — no SAS-signed URL juggling like flow run actions need.
